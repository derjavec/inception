Inception is a project designed to deepen your knowledge of system administration through the use of Docker. The goal is to create and manage a containerized infrastructure, ensuring a secure, modular, and scalable environment.

Through this project, you will learn how to virtualize multiple services using Docker Compose, creating isolated containers that communicate through an internal network. Additionally, you will implement volumes for data persistence and apply best security practices when configuring the services.

This project provides hands-on experience in container orchestration, networking, and system security, reinforcing fundamental DevOps principles. ðŸš€
